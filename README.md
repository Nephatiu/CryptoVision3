## The Official 3rd Version of the CryptoVision Companion App
==========================================================

This source-code is released for transparancy and insight rather than to build yourself, though it should be buildable with Android Studio.

Occasional test-builds are available in the [Builds-folder](https://github.com/Nephatiu/CryptoVision3/tree/base/builds)

So far only test-builds are available until the final release of v3.00. These builds are numbered and although not every build gets provided in apk, the test-builds that are present should be up to date with the latest github commits as they usually get pushed along with their source-code updates.

When available, releases will also be linked here.

### Good-to-knows:

  - Follow the arrow shown on first boot to our useful settings!

  - There's an activatable Easter Egg hidden somewhere that will slightly liven up your interface.

  - Will load any external site externally, except for the node monitor.

  - Tapping any empty space in the bottom bar on the main window will refresh cVn, tapping it while on the Node Monitor brings you back to cVn.

  - Can be made immersive (full screen) and show a clock in the app to effortlessly keep track of time.

  - New round app-style, out with the amateuristic square look.

  - Has animated buttons for fun.

  - No learningcurve, just direct usefulness. ;p
